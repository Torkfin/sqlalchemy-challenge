The two files in this repository are the SQLAPP.PY file that contains the Python Code used to generate my flask server and manage API calls.  The climate_final.inynb file is the jupyter notebook that includes the code to assess the climate in Hawaii.  

This was quite a challenging assignment and it was great to learn how to create a flask server and set up API calls.  I am planning to do the extra credit the week of 3/7 to get more practice, but have linked to this on my assignment page as this homework is officially due.
